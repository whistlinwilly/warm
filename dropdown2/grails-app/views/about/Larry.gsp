Larry rounds out the founding partners at Wexford Farms Pet Food.  He is our Dr. Nutrition.  He attained his undergraduate degree from Rose-Hulman and went onto University of Illinois for his Masters and PhD in Biochemistry.  After giving up his career as a professional student, Larry decided it was time to hit the work force and joined Quaker Foods. From there he went onto H.J. Heinz and Del Monte Foods until he decided to join the rag tag team of Wexford Farms. What makes Larry so good at his job? Curiosity. He loves to solve problems. Whether it’s science-related or not, he’s always up for a challenge.

Larry was born and raised just outside of Indianapolis, IN.  He lives in Pittsburgh, PA with his adoring wife Jill and their two cats Sammy and Katie. Larry has spent extensive time researching his family’s genealogy and history. When he’s not tracing his roots, he can be found fixing stuff around the house.
