<b><u>Function</u>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
Cell membrane integrity</b> – choline is used in the body to build larger molecules that serve as structural components of cell membranes.
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<b>Intra-cellular signaling</b> – other molecules made from choline act as messengers between cells or as transmitters for nerve impulses. 
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<b>Fat transport and metabolism</b> – another compound made from choline, phosphatidylcholine is essential for transport of fats and cholesterol through the blood.  Without enough choline, fat and cholesterol accumulate in the liver.
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<b>Cardiovascular health</b> – In the body, choline can be converted to betaine, which helps to control the level of homocysteine in the blood and keep your dog’s cardiovascular system healthy.
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<b>DNA synthesis</b> – in the body, folic acid is quickly converted to folate and incorporated into folate coenzymes which are essential for the synthesis of DNA.
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<b>Methylation reactions</b> – the formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the most common methyl donor in the body, requires folate coenzymes. Methyl donors like SAM help control which genes are expressed, and when.  Methylation is also a critical step in many biosynthetic pathways, as it results in the transfer of a one-carbon unit (a methyl group) from one molecule to another.
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<b>Other functions</b> – folate works along with vitamin B12 and vitamin C to help the body break down, use, and create new proteins. The vitamin also serves an important role in the formation of red and white blood cells.
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<b>Energy production</b> – vitamin B12 is essential for the production of energy from fats and proteins.  That means that vitamin B12 is involved in the metabolism of every cell of your dog’s body.
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<b>Nerve function</b> – B12 is involved in the formation of myelin, the protective coating that surrounds nerve fibers. It is also needed to produce neurotransmitters, the chemicals that carry nerve signals between cells.
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<b>Other functions</b> – vitamin B12 also works in conjunction with vitamin C and folate to help form hemoglobin and to support DNA synthesis and regulation of DNA and RNA.
