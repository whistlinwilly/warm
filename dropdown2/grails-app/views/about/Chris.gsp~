Chris is another founding partner of Wexford Farms Pet Foods. He’s our numbers guy.
<br>
Chris received his B.S. in Accounting from the University of Scranton, graduating Magna Cum Laude.  After working as a C.P.A. for Aramark and KPMG, he went on to serve in a number of Finance positions with increasing responsibility for the H. J. Heinz Company, including Chief Financial Officer of Heinz North America and Chief Operating Officer of Western Europe in Paris, France.  Chris then went on to flex his entrepreneurial muscles taking on the role of President & Chief Operating Officer for Birds Eye Foods, Inc.  The company was successfully sold in 2010 to a private venture group, and Chris went on to consult for various Private Equity firms on acquisitions.  In 2011, Chris decided it was time to start his own business, and co-founded Wexford Farms Pet Foods. 
<br>
Chris and his wife hail from Philadelphia, PA, but now call Pittsburgh, PA home. Chris spends time with his wonderful wife, Christina, twin daughters, Grabriela and xxxxx and his most adorable Shitzu, Piper. (It’s fair to say the dog rules the house).  When Chris is not with this family, he enjoys volunteering  with XXXxx group and working out at the gym.  He is a passionate Philly sports fan, and has raised his kids accordingly.
