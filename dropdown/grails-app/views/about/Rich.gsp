Rich is one of three founding partners, and our head of Research and Development. In a nutshell, he’s the science guy.  
<br><br>
Rich earned a B.S. in Chemical Engineering and in Chemistry from Purdue University. He began a pretty amazing career at General Foods Corporation (now Kraft General Foods Inc.), where he launched several processes and products, including Honey Bunches of Oats.  From there he went on to hold various positions at the H.J. Heinz Company where he developed expertise in the pet food business, and was appointed Vice President Research & Quality Systems.  His responsibilities included leading major domestic and international acquisitions, including Meow Mix and Milk-Bone, and commercializing several hundred new products across human and pet food categories.
<br><br>
Prior to starting Wedford Farms, Mr. Rothamel served as Vice-President Product Development Private Brands at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. He was responsible for product development and quality for all grocery private brands.  Mr. Rothamel holds six U.S. patents and served on the Board of Directors for the Pet Food Institute from 2000-2004. 
<br><br>
Rich was born in Key West, Florida, but called the eastern seaboard his home, as his father was a Commander in the U.S. Navy.  Rich resides in Pittsburgh, PA with his lovely wife Karen, dog Ellie and his two cats Mo and Sarah. He is a loyal Purdue fan, and when he’s not spending time with the family or at the office, he’s up on his ranch just north of Pittsburgh, farming and hiking.
