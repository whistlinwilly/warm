Ever noticed your dog is the only member of your family not getting a warm meal? Doesn’t seem fair does it? That’s why we created WarmUps!, the first pet product specially formulated to deliver your dog a warm, wholesome meal without any fuss or muss. 
<br><br>
We specifically designed Warm Ups! to provide your dog with the most robust, great-tasting meal experience, while creating minimum work for you. We cook to show love for friends, family, so why not our pets? That same thought went into Warm Ups! By adding hot water from your tap, you can prepare the warm nourishment your dog needs and deserves.
