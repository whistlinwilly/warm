<div id="tips">
Aside from enhancing your dog’s every day meal, Warm Ups can be used in other ways.
<ul>
<li>Sick or Stressed Dogs: Dog not eating? There are many circumstances that cause pets not to eat.  New pets often experience stress. Warm ups can be used to help stimulate appetite and help maintain weight when they are not feeling well. If your pet is sick, please make sure to consult your vet.</li>
<li>Medicine Delivery: Is your dog on supplements or medicines that don’t taste so good? It can be a struggle to get the necessary medicines to our dogs. Use Warm Ups to mask the icky taste of those pills, so your dog can still get what he needs without stressing you out. </li>
<li>Boarded Pets: Some dogs lose their appetite when boarded. It’s clear they miss you, but you can alleviate that angst by dropping off some Warm Ups with your dog’s food the next time you board them. They get a warm comforting meal they know and love, and you’ll feel better knowing they are eating well.</li>
<li>Mid Day Snack: Long time between meals? We get to eat 3x a day, so why not your dog?  Feed Warm Ups as a mid-day snack to tide your pet over till dinner. Then you won’t have to see that sad little stare they give you when you are eating and they are not. </li>
</ul>
