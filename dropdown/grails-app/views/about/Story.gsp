Wexford Farms LLC, was started from an idea that our pets are not just animals, but family.  For each of us, pets play an important part in our lives.  They have been there to celebrate the successes and console us when things got rough.  They are not just our best friends, they are family, and we wanted to find a way to show them how much we love them. And, nothing says that better than a warm belly full of food.

Because we are smaller, privately-owned, we do things the right way. We put a lot of thought into the ingredients that go into each of our products to ensure your dog gets the very best.
